**Summary**


This Jupyter Notebook is part of the Applied Statistics course and contains the first lab assignment. The goal of this lab is to explore and analyze the provided dataset using various statistical methods and techniques. Below is an outline of the notebook's contents and the steps involved in the analysis.

1. Introduction
The notebook begins with an overview of the lab assignment, detailing the objectives and the specific questions we aim to address through our analysis.

2. Data Import and Initial Setup
In this section, we import the necessary libraries such as pandas and matplotlib. We also load the dataset and perform initial configurations required for the subsequent analysis.

3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
We clean the dataset by handling missing values, correcting data types, and performing any other necessary preprocessing tasks. This ensures the data is in a suitable format for analysis.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This section involves exploring the dataset through various visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots) and statistical summaries. The goal is to identify patterns, trends, and potential outliers in the data.

5. Statistical Analysis
Here, we apply various statistical tests and models to the data. This may include hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and other inferential statistics to draw meaningful conclusions from the data.

6. Results Visualization and Interpretation
We generate visualizations to present the results of our statistical analyses. This section also includes interpretations of these results, explaining what they mean in the context of the research questions posed at the beginning.

7. Conclusion
The notebook concludes with a summary of the findings from the analysis. We discuss any significant insights gained and their implications. Additionally, we may suggest potential areas for further research or analysis based on our results.
